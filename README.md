# zemico-game-codes
brief introduction.

In the board game "Zemico", players play the role of the builder of the ecosystem. They obtain resources and species by drawing cards with points, placing cards and counting points to play with other three players, and finally complete their secret mission cards.

Game background

Players are employees of different ecosystem companies involved in the project given by government. You and three other players will be sent to a place called 〝Zemico〞 and build up an ecosystem there. However, before you  embark, you receive a text from your boss...

Game accessories

Two decks of playing cards, table (playing on the ground is also OK).

The first deck of playing cards, as an organism card deck, is divided into: decompser card, producer card, herbivorous consumer card, and carnivorous consumer card (13 cards with points from 1 to 13 for each).

The second deck of playing card, as a supplementary accessory, is divided into: environment card(12 cards), energy card(13 cards), and mission card(13 cards).

The desktop represents the physical environment of the ecosystem.

Ready to start

1. Game objectives

At the end of the turn, if the organism card deck is empty, the game ends.

At the end of the game, the player who achieves one's mission card wins. If no player or more than one player achieve the mission card, the player with the mission card that has the largest point wins.

(On the desk, the number of all type of organism cards must be ≥ 1, otherwise no one wins)

2.Process introduction:

Preparation: select the environment card - decide the mission card - complete the game setup - initial round

Game: change cards - plan (play cards in turn on the desktop) - survive (determine the survival and extinction of organism cards according to their adjacent organism cards)

3. Select environment card

The point of environment card represents the ability of the ecosystem to fix the energy.

(In other words, the smaller the point of environment card, the more difficult it is to build the ecosystem, and vice versa)

Select or draw an environment card and place it on the desk where everyone can see it.

4. Determine the mission card

Each player draws three mission cards, read and select one, discard the rest, and place the selected one horizontally in front of oneself with the back facing up.

mission cards with varied points have varied content:

(make sure that number mentioned here is not the point of a card, but the number of cards on the desk)


5. Hand out the starting hand

Shuffle four types of organism cards into one deck. After shuffling, each player draw 4 card from the deck as the starting hand.

Put the shuffled four decks of organism cards (collectively referred to as the organism card deck) and the shuffled energy card (referred to as the energy card deck) on the table with the back facing up. 

Guess the fist to decide the starting player.

The game officially begins.

Play games

When playing the game, start from the starting player and take turns in counter-clockwise.

Each round is divided into three stages, and all players enter the next stage after completing the actions of this stage:

Change-of-cards stage (don't do this in the first round).

Discard any hand, and then draw up to four organism cards.

(Discard, put the card face up into the corresponding discard pile; draw, take the card at the top of the deck from the corresponding deck)

Planning stage.

In this stage, when it is the player's turn to act, the player has the following two choices:

1. Put an organism card in hand onto the desk. If there are other organism cards on the desk, it must be placed in the space adjacent to any organism card (if an organism card is adjacent to another organism card, it means that the other organism card is at one of the 8 blocks around this organism card).

2. Skip.

Players who do not choose to skip continue this process until everyone chooses to skip.

Survival stage.

At this stage, there is only one player to act, and this player needs to have the least number of hands. If the number of players with the least number of hands is more than one, the starting player will choose one from them.

Perform the following actions in sequence:
(Producer cards represent plants and energy cards represent all energy required by plants to grow. Herbivourous consumer cards represent animals eating plants while herbivourous consumer cards represent animals eating meat. Finally, decomposer cards represent animals, plants, or bacterias that eat rot materials.)

1. Discard the energy card next to the environment card (don't do this in the first round) and draw one energy card. 
Point of each producer card in this stage is regarded as [the smaller value between (the point of drawn energy card+the point of stored energy card(the maximum stored energy is the point of the environment card) and (the point of this producer card)]. Place the energy card next to the environment card.

2. Discard all herbivourous consumer cards that aren't adjacent to any producer card. 
For each herbivourous consumer cards that is adjacent to producer cards, if the sum of points of producer cards adjacent to it ≥  the point of this herbivourous consumer card, decrease points of producer cards (the decrese is allocated by the player, point of each producer card must be at least 0) by the point of this herbivourous consumer card.
Else, discard all producer cards adjacent to this herbivourous consumer card.
The player can determine the sequence of this process on each herbivourous consumer card.

3. Repeat the same process over carnivorous consumer cards and herbivourous consumer cards.

4. Discard all decompser cards that aren't adjacent to any non-decompser card.
For each non-decompser card, if the sum of points of decompser cards adjacent to it ＜ the point of this organism card, discard it.

At the end of the survival stage, the player who takes action at this stage becomes the starting player of the next round.
 
Enter the next round.

1. Cooperation mode

At the end of the round, if the number of all types of organism card is ≥ 1, draw an environment card, if the number of non-decompser card organism cards ≥/＜ the point of environment card, and the point of environment cardal cards drawn ＞/＜ the number of original environment card, replace the original environment card with the drawn one, otherwise, the environment cardal cards drawn will be shuffled back to the environment card deck.

At the end of the game, if the number of environment cardal cards ≥ 10, all players win.

Migration mode
Recommended game setting:
Place 5 random environment, 1 energy card with point 4, and a dice with 4 faced up on the table.
Mix and shuffle all the organisms cards and 1 energy card into one deck.
Hand out 5 organisms cards to each player as the initial hands.
Guess the fist to decide the starting player.

Play games:
When playing the game, start from the starting player and take turns in counter-clockwise.
When it is the player's turn to act, the player has the following two choices:
1.place a hand onto an environment card.
2.move an organism card to a proper place.
When placing or moving, players have to follow these rules:
1.Producers can be placed on environment cards with points ≥ that of producers.
2.Herbivourous consumers can be placed on environment cards, producers with points ≥ that of producers.
3.Carnivorous...environment cards, producers, Herbivourous consumers...
4.Decomposers...environment cards, producers, Herbivourous consumers, and Carnivorous consumers...However, once a decomposer is placed, no one can move it.

When any player draw the energy card inside the deck, from now on, change the "≥" inside the rules into "≤".
